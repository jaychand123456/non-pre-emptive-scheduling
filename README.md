# non-pre-emptive-scheduling
The aim of this project is to develop/implement an algorithm that schedules given process along with their arrival time and burst time and then schedule them based on non pre-emptive shortest job next and priority(based on waiting time).
Priority for this project is calculated as follows:
    priority = 1 + (waiting time/estimated run time);
